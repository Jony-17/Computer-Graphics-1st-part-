The first part of the project would be divided into 5 modules, which consisted of:
 - First module: Develop an object in JavaScript to model a box with its top open. Develop a visual console that had the following buttons: a button to view it as well as a button to clear the rendering area.
 - Second module: Add two buttons that consist of activating the perspective and orthographic camera. Add interactivity to the rendering area, through the THREE.TrackballControls, THREE.OrbitControls, FirstPersonControls and FlyControls objects, activating each of these controls using buttons. In addition to these buttons, create another one in order to visualize an object that models a shelf that has boxes, with certain supports with different sizes and rotations.
 - Third module: Develop an object that models a warehouse, consisting of three shelves. Add a button that allows you to view it.
 - Fourth module: Add ambient light and spotlights to the warehouse.
 - Fifth module: Develop an object that models a robot capable of moving between shelves.
